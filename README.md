This is what I want to do as it is the entry level when going into an investment bank. Companies that have interested me are top investment banks, such as goldman sachs, deutche bank and jp morgan.

For my coursework, I am currently working on a stock paper trading simulator, that blends both fantasy football and the stock market into an interactive and fun game. That also allows you to learn how to trade without it sometimes being quite boring.
